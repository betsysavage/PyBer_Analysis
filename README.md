#PyBer_Analysis#

##Overview of the analysis##

PyBer leadership has requested an analysis of trips, drivers, and fares from their rideshare data by market type. The goal of this analysis is to discover rideshare patterns in the markets of different city types in order to better understand gaps in access and affordability between markets. The analysis is based on Pyber's csv files of city data and ride data.

##Results##
To complete this analysis, we merged the two csv files into a single data frame, then grouped the data by city types to target our review by markets. Using the sum and count functions, we created variables to capture summary statistics for total/average rides, drivers, and fares for each market. The summary data frame containing these variables appears below.

##Summary##
From the patterns in ride sharing revenue revealed in the analysis, I recommend that the company leverage this information in the following ways:
1. The urban market performs best in terms of overall revenue and the number of ride-sharing drivers the comapny is able to attract. The company should continue to invest in growth in new urban markets, as it will continue to produce a majority of the company's revenue portfolio.
2. While the rural market is the lowest in terms of overall fares, the average fare per driver is significantly higher than that of urban drivers. It is likely that the length of each ride is longer in rural areas due to general spread between landmarks and limited options for public transportation. Though rural markets will never comprise a majority of the business's portfolio, expanding into a few of these markets would be an option with relatively low start-up costs due to the limited amount of staffing they would require.
